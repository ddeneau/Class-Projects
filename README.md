# Class-Projects
Python, SQL, JavaScript, &amp; R projects. Organized by language. Topics include data engineering, web development, and data science. 
The repository is organized by class and primary programming langauge. Each folder has assignments, labs, and a final project, depending on the class.
The files are a mix of different things. Jupyter notebooks, expo projects, indivdual scripts, and CSV/Excel files.

Most of the work was done individually, with most final projects done in teams. Proper credit is given in all final reports.

# Sections

## Intro to Data Science (Python/Go)
One python folder contains work from an introductory python class, which is a little basic, but still interesting.
In the intro to data science folder, theres 4 module projects, done individually, using publically available datasets, and SKLearn.
There is also a final project, using Go for data collection, and Python for data analysis.


## Database Design and Administration (SQL)
This section showcases some advanced queries written for an advanced databases class
each of which are located in files within either the assignemnts, or labs folders.

The Team Project folder shows our work designing and developing a MySQL Server database for park and trail enthusiasts.



## Dynamic Web Applications (JavaScript, HTML & CSS)
Like the other sections, this folder contains all of the assignments done for a web development class. 
They are located within the lab-work folder, within the client folder, as numbered lab folders.

My final team project for this class can be found here:
