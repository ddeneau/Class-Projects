## Problems  5.2,  5.5,  5.7,  5.9,  5.15,  5.25,  5.26,  5.37


## Problem 5.2:
a) proportion
b) proportion
c) mean
d) mean
e) mean

## Probelm 5.5:
a) Normal Distribution
b) Mostly because the non-profit expects the population proportion of households with elevated
    lead levels to be 5%-30%, I expect the distribution to be skewed to the left, with most 
    households having low-to-average lead levels in their drinking water, and a few outliers 
    with higher levels.
c) The variability is: 0.0086
d) Standard error
e) The variability will decrease as the number of observations per sample is lower.
