## Reddit Graph Project.

This project creates a network based on a reddit user's submission history, to visualize activity accross the platform.
With these connections, you can see the way that certain subreddits are associated with each other, from the perspective of
a user's posting of comments and posts.

## Usage

1) You'll need these two libraries: 
  import praw
  import networkx

2) Clone this repository to somewhere, ideally in a folder where you have some Python environment set-up already.

3) Get your free praw keys, and replace the hastags, and type your reddit username in for the "[Username]" string, at the top of the project. 

4) See where you can change some parameters and go find out some interesting trends on Reddit!
